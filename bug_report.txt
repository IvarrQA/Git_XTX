Sorting is not possible, in the women's shoes section, because when you click "Sort" it is sorted randomly
1 Open on website: https://mercurio.netlify.app/
2 Click on "Women" in the header
3 Click on "Shop Now" button
4 Click on dropdown "Sort: Price: high to low"
Products are sorted randomly, hence the user will not see products from high to low price
Goods are sorted from high to low price
Thank you for your attention
